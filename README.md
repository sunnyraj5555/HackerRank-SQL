# Theory
- Using UPPERCASE for the SQL keywords helps make the script more understandable.

Q. Why is SQL written in uppercase?
- It's using case as a form of syntax highlighting. It makes the logic distinct from the table names and field names. 
It's a form that predates new-fangled things like having more than one colour on a screen.
